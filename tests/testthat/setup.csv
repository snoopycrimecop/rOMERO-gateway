# Adjust this to match your test server setup.
# The server is expected to have:
# - (At least) one project (see projectid), containing (exact) one dataset
#   (see datasetid), containing (exact) one image (see imageid).
# - The image should have a couple of annotations (see numberofannotations),
#   including a file annotation with a specific file name (see fileannotationname);
#   its content doesn't matter.
# - (At least) one screen (see screenid) with (exact) one plate (see plateid) with
#   a specific number of (non-empty) wells (see platesize), where each well has a
#   specific number of fields (see wellsize)
# - A map annotation with a specific key-value-pair (see mapannotation) attached to
#   the screen mentioned before
